0.9.0
-----

This release adds support for "holding" a power profile while running a task
or application, making it possible to switch to a performance profile during
a compilation, or to a power-saver profile when low on battery, reverting to
the original profile when done.

This release also removes the "inhibited" property for the performance profile,
which made it impossible to switch to that profile, and replaces it with the
"degraded" property which lists why performance is degraded.

Finally, the last used profile is now remembered across reboots.

0.8.1
-----

This release works-around a cosmetic issue in gnome-shell animations when
on battery and using the intel-pstate driver.

API to replace the Lenovo specific `dytc_perfmode`, meaning it should also
support profile selection on a number of HP and Microsoft Surface devices.

This release also add the `powerprofilesctl` command-line application.
